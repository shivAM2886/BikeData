1. **aggregate_pickups_dropoffs**

Assign the total number of pickups and dropoffs at each intersection. 

Basic Logic:
In the trip dataset we have the start and end location, along with the nearest 
intersection the start or end location belongs to. We iterate through the trip dataset,
and store the number of pickups and dropoffs attributed to each of the intersection.

The trip dataset contains all the dockless trips in the year 2019. 

# Note
***Attributing a location to nearest intersection***
The dockless bikes are scattered in different regions, in the project we attribute it to the nearest tarffic intersection.
Attributing to a nearest traffic intersection means we assume that the pickups and dropoffs originated or ended from the intersection
instead of the lon and lat location provided in the trip dataset.
This provides a way for us to divide the city.

2. cluster_formation_default_dist_250m.ipynb

Input file Name : total_pickups_dropoffs_at_intersections.csv
Output File Name : total_pickups_dropoffs_cluster_id_250m_at_intersections.csv


Out of the 8437 total intersections in DC, only 2000 of them have appreciable number
of pickups and dropoffs. Using this file we form cluster of intersections. 

Output file contains 1630 intersections which now have associated cluster ids. Cluster ID points
out to the ID of central intersection of the cluster.

Input File Name : "total_pickups_dropoffs_cluster_id_250m_at_intersections.csv"
Output File Name : "cluster_hhi_results.csv"

Calculates HHI for clusters in Washington DC.  
Output file contains the following columns:

1. cluster_ids	>> Cluster ID for which HHI is calculated.
2. c_len	      >> Total Intersections in the cluster.
3. all_c_pickups >> Total pickups from the intersection.	
4. all_c_dropoffs	>> Total dropoffs from the intersection.
5. all_phhi	>> PICKUP HHI
6. all_dhhi >> DROPOFF HHI	
7. all_hhi_ratio	>> PICKUP HHI / DROPOFF HHI
